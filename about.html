            <header>About Me
            <p>I'm Josiah Low, a student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
            <p1>
            I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology (IT). 
            As time goes on, the need for IT related jobs has increased, and
            that influenced me to take the course that I'm taking now.
            </p1>
            <p2>
            I enjoy solving problems, so taking an IT course has truly helped
            to fulfil that enjoyment. Aside from solving problems, I am also 
            capable of staying on task. I would work at the given problem 
            until I either managed to find the right answer or explanation to
            the question.
            </p2>
            <p3>
            Despite being an introvert, I am willing to go out of my comfort 
            zone to work with others, and to learn and grow together. I believe
            that these skills will help me especially during any team projects. 
            </p3>
