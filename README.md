This will be my Portfolio for Assignment 1 of ID. It will be a fully responsive website that allows a user to see key features that may interest them (if they are looking to hire).


**Design Process**
This website is a Portfolio, meant for future Employers who may be looking to hire. The goal of my website is to be able to sell myself in the best light possible, and to eventually get hired.

As a student and future employee, I want to be able to sell myslef as best as possible, so that I can get hired and thus have a job.

**Technologies Used**
HTML
HTML is the main bulk of this project

CSS
I used inline CSS for my project to style the Website

**Testing**
On desktop, the website is a lot more spacious. On a mobile device, its not as spacious but the content can still fit in it.

An interesting bug found is that the min-device-width and max-device-width seem to be deprecated, even though that is how we were taught to use them. There is another issue, which states that element style not allowed as child of element body in this context, which is weird, because my website still runs fine. I haven't been able to find an answer to this problem.
